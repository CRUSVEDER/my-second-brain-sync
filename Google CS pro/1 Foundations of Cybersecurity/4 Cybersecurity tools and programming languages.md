## SIEM tools

SIEM tools = security information and event management tools. E.g.:

- Splunk
- Google's Chronicle
- Presumably also things like Embrace etc (when using more inputs)

## Playbooks

2 common examples on forensic cases:

1. **Chain of custody**: Similar to IRL police, documenting who/what/where/why evidence is collected, who is responsible, tracking it, etc.
2. **Protecting and preserving evidence**: Need to know what is fragile / volatile. Something called the "order of volatility" exists, essentially just save the volatile stuff (e.g. RAM) first, whereas HDDs are stable.
