Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is mainly used for network diagnostics and error reporting. Two popular commands rely on ICMP, and they are instrumental in network troubleshooting and network security. The commands are:

- `ping`: This command uses ICMP to test connectivity to a target system and measures the round-trip time (RTT). In other words, it can be used to learn that the target is alive and that its reply can reach our system.
- `traceroute`: This command is called `traceroute` on Linux and UNIX-like systems and `tracert` on MS Windows systems. It uses ICMP to discover the route from your host to the target.

### Ping

You may have never played ping-pong (table tennis) before; however, thanks to ICMP, you can now play it with the computer! The `ping` command sends an ICMP Echo Request (ICMP Type `8`). The screenshot below shows the ICMP message within an IP packet.

The computer on the receiving end responds with an ICMP Echo Reply (ICMP Type `0`).

Many things might prevent us from getting a reply. In addition to the possibility of the target system being offline or shut down, a firewall along the path might block the necessary packets for `ping` to work. In the example below, we used `-c 4` to tell the `ping` command to stop after sending four packets.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ ping 192.168.11.1 -c 4
PING 192.168.11.1 (192.168.11.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.11.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=11.2 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.11.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=3.81 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.11.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=3.99 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.11.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=23.4 ms

--- 192.168.11.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3003ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 3.805/10.596/23.366/7.956 ms
```

The output shows no packet loss; moreover, it calculates the minimum, average, maximum, and standard deviation (mdev) of the round-trip time (RTT).

### Traceroute

How can we make every router between our system and a target system reveal itself?

The Internet protocol has a field called Time-to-Live (TTL) that indicates the maximum number of routers a packet can travel through before it is dropped. The router decrements the packet’s TTL by one before it sends it across. When the TTL reaches zero, the router drops the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message (ICMP Type `11`). (In this context, “time” is measured in the number of routers, not seconds.)

The terminal output below shows the result of running `traceroute` to discover the routers between our system and `example.com`. Some routers don’t respond; in other words, they drop the packet without sending any ICMP messages. Routers that belong to our ISP might respond, revealing their private IP address. Moreover, some routers respond and show their public IP address, and this would let us look up their domain name and discover their geographic location. Finally, there is always a possibility that an ICMP Time Exceeded message gets blocked and never reaches us.
