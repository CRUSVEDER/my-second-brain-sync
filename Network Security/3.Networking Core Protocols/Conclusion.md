In the previous room, we discussed the TELNET protocol; this room focused on other fundamental protocols: DNS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. With the protocols covered, we now have a better understanding of how domain names are resolved, how web pages are served, and how email is sent and received. Another primary purpose of this room is to give you a good understanding of how a protocol functions behind the graphical interfaces.

The table below summarizes the default port numbers of the protocols we have covered so far.

|**Protocol**|**Transport Protocol**|**Default Port Number**|
|---|---|---|
|TELNET|TCP|23|
|DNS|UDP or TCP|53|
|HTTP|TCP|80|
|HTTPS|TCP|443|
|FTP|TCP|21|
|SMTP|TCP|25|
|POP3|TCP|110|
|IMAP|TCP|143|
