Do you remember the IP addresses of your favourite websites? Unless it is a private IP address of a local device, no one needs to worry about memorizing IP addresses. This is in part due to the Domain Name System (DNS), which is responsible for properly mapping a domain name to an IP address.

DNS operates at the Application Layer, i.e., Layer 7 of the ISO OSI model. DNS traffic uses UDP port 53 by default and TCP port 53 as a default fallback. There are many types of DNS records; however, in this task, we will focus on the following four:

- **A record**: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set `example.com` to resolve to `172.17.2.172`.
- **AAAA Record**: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to _Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting_; neither falls under DNS.
- **CNAME Record**: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, `www.example.com` can be mapped to `example.com` or even to `example.org`.
- **MX Record**: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.

In other words, when you type `example.com` in your browser, your browser tries to resolve this domain name by querying the DNS server for the A record. However, when you try to send an email to `test@example.com`, the mail server would query the DNS server to find the MX record.

If you want to look up the IP address of a domain from the command line, you can use a tool such as `nslookup`. Consider the example in the terminal below where we look up `example.com`.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ nslookup www.example.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   www.example.com
Address: 93.184.215.14
Name:   www.example.com
Address: 2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c
```

The query above led to four packets. In the terminal below, we can see that the first and third packets send DNS queries for the A and AAAA records, respectively. The second and fourth packets show the DNS query responses.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ tshark -r dns-query.pcapng -Nn
