You’ve received an email and want to download it to your local mail client. The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is designed to allow the client to communicate with a mail server and retrieve email messages.

Without going into in-depth technical details, an email client sends its messages by relying on SMTP and retrieves them using POP3. SMTP is similar to handing your envelope or package to the post office, and POP3 is similar to checking your local mailbox for new letters or packages.

![POP3 is like a personal mailbox. SMTP is like the Post Office designated box.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1726733700701.svg)  

Some common POP3 commands are:

- `USER <username>` identifies the user
- `PASS <password>` provides the user’s password
- `STAT` requests the number of messages and total size
- `LIST` lists all messages and their sizes
- `RETR <message_number>` retrieves the specified message
- `DELE <message_number>` marks a message for deletion
- `QUIT` ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions

In the terminal below, we can see a POP3 session over telnet. Since the POP3 server listens on TCP port 110 by default, the command to connect to the TELNET port is `telnet MACHINE_IP 110`. The exchange below retrieves the email message sent in the previous task.

Someone capturing the network packets would be able to intercept the exchanged traffic. As per previous Wireshark captures, the commands in red are sent by the client, and the lines in blue are the server’s. It is also clear that someone capturing the traffic can read the passwords.

Connecting to a POP3 server requires authentication. Use the following login credentials when needed:

- Username: `linda`
- Password: `Pa$$123`
