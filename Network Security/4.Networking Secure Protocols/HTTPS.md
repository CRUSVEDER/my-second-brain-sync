### HTTP

As we studied in the [Networking Core Protocols](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/networkingcoreprotocols) room, HTTP relies on TCP and uses port 80 by default. We also saw how all HTTP traffic was sent in cleartext for anyone to intercept and monitor. The screenshot below is from the previous room, and it gives a clear idea of how an adversary can easily read all the traffic exchanged between the client and the server.

Let’s take a minute to review the most common steps before a web browser can request a page over HTTP. After resolving the domain name to an IP address, the client will carry out the following two steps:

1. Establish a TCP three-way handshake with the target server
2. Communicate using the HTTP protocol; for example, issue HTTP requests, such as `GET / HTTP/1.1`

The two steps described above are shown in the window below. The three packets for the TCP handshake (marked with 1) precede the first HTTP packet with `GET` in it. The HTTP communication is marked with 2. The last three displayed packets are for TCP connection termination and are marked with 3.

### HTTP Over TLS

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is basically HTTP over TLS. Consequently, requesting a page over HTTPS will require the following three steps (after resolving the domain name):

1. Establish a TCP three-way handshake with the target server
2. Establish a TLS session
3. Communicate using the HTTP protocol; for example, issue HTTP requests, such as `GET / HTTP/1.1`

The screenshot below shows that a TCP session is established in the first three packets, marked with `1`. Then, several packets are exchanged to negotiate the TLS protocol, marked with `2`. `1` and `2` are where the **TLS negotiation and establishment** take place.

Finally, HTTP application data is exchanged, marked with `3`. Looking at the Wireshark screenshot, we see that it says “Application Data” because there is no way to know if it is indeed HTTP or some other protocol sent over port 443.

As expected, if one tries to follow the stream of packets and combine all their contents, they will only get gibberish, as shown in the screenshot below. The exchanged traffic is encrypted; the red is sent by the client, and the blue is sent by the server. There is no way to know the contents without acquiring the encryption key.

#### Getting the Encryption Key

Adding TLS to HTTP leads to all the packets being encrypted. We can no longer see the contents of the exchanged packets unless we get access to the private key. Although it is improbable that we will have access to the keys used for encryption in a TLS session, we repeated the above screenshots after providing the decryption key to Wireshark. The TCP and TLS handshakes don’t change; the main difference starts with the HTTP protocol marked 3. For instance, we can see when the client issues a `GET`.

If you want to see the data exchanged, now is your chance! It is still regular HTTP traffic hidden from prying eyes.

The key takeaway is that TLS offered security for HTTP without requiring any changes in the lower or higher layer protocols. In other words, TCP and IP were not modified, while HTTP was sent over TLS the way it would be sent over TCP.
