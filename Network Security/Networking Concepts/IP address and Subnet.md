When you hear the word IP address, you might think of an address like `192.168.0.1` or something less common, such as `172.16.159.243`. In both cases, you are right. Both of these are IP addresses; IPv4 (IP version 4) addresses to be specific.

Every host on the network needs a unique identifier for other hosts to communicate with him. Without a unique identifier, the host cannot be found without ambiguity. When using the TCP/IP protocol suite, we need to assign an IP address for each device connected to the network.

One analogy of an IP address is your home postal address. Your postal address allows you to receive letters and parcels from all over the world. Furthermore, it can identify your home without ambiguity; otherwise, you cannot shop online!

As you might already know, we have IPv4 and IPv6 (IP version 6). IPv4 is still the most common, and whenever you come across a text mentioning IP without the version, we expect them to mean IPv4.

So, what makes an IP address? An IP address comprises four octets, i.e., 32 bits. Being 8 bits, an octet allows us to represent a decimal number between 0 and 255. An IP address is shown in the image below.

![An IP address is made up of 4 octets or bytes and each octet represents a decimal number between 0 and 255.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719849005781.png)  

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the 0 and 255 are reserved for the network and broadcast addresses, respectively. In other words, `192.168.1.0` is the network address, while `192.168.1.255` is the broadcast address. Sending to the broadcast address targets all the hosts on the network. With simple math, you can conclude that we cannot have more than 4 billion unique IPv4 addresses. If you are curious about the math, it is approximately 232 because we have 32 bits. This number is approximate because we didn’t consider network and broadcast addresses.

### Looking Up Your Network Configuration

You can look up your IP address on the MS Windows command line using the command `ipconfig`. On Linux and UNIX-based systems, you can issue the command `ifconfig` or `ip address show`, which can be typed as `ip a s`. In the terminal window below, we show `ifconfig`.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ ifconfig
[...]
wlo1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.66.89  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.66.255
        inet6 fe80::73e1:ca5e:3f93:b1b3  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether cc:5e:f8:02:21:a7  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 19684680  bytes 18865072842 (17.5 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 364  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 14439678  bytes 8773200951 (8.1 GiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

The terminal output above indicates the following:

- The host (laptop) IP address is `192.168.66.89`
- The subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`
- The broadcast address is `192.168.66.255`

Let’s use `ip a s` to compare how the network card IP address is presented.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ ip a s
[...]
4: wlo1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether cc:5e:f8:02:21:a7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname wlp3s0
    inet 192.168.66.89/24 brd 192.168.66.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlo1
       valid_lft 36795sec preferred_lft 36795sec
    inet6 fe80::73e1:ca5e:3f93:b1b3/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

The terminal output above indicates the following:

- The host (laptop) IP address is `192.168.66.89/24`
- The broadcast address is `192.168.66.255`

If you are wondering, a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` can also be written as `/24`. The `/24` means that the leftmost 24 bits within the IP address do not change across the network, i.e., the subnet. In other words, the leftmost three octets are the same across the whole subnet; therefore, we can expect to find addresses that range from `192.168.66.1` to `192.168.66.254`. Similar to what was mentioned earlier, `192.168.66.0` and `192.168.66.255` are the network and broadcast addresses, respectively.

### Private Addresses

As we are explaining IP addresses, it is useful to mention that for most practical purposes, there are two types of IP addresses:

- Public IP addresses
- Private IP addresses

RFC 1918 defines the following three ranges of private IP addresses:

- `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (`10/8`)
- `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (`172.16/12`)
- `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (`192.168/16`)

We presented earlier an analogy stating that a public IP address is like your home postal address. A private IP address is different; the original idea is that it cannot reach or be reached from the outside world. It is like an isolated city or a compound, where all houses and apartments are numbered systematically and can easily exchange mail with each other, but not with the outside world. For a private IP address to access the Internet, the router must have a public IP address and must support Network Address Translation (NAT). At this stage, let’s not worry about understanding how NAT works, as we will revisit it later in this module.

Before moving on, I recommend memorising the private IP address ranges. Otherwise, you might see an IP address such as `10.1.33.7` or `172.31.33.7` and try to access it from a public IP address.

### Routing

A router is like your local post office; you hand them the mail parcel, and they would know how to deliver it. If we dig deeper, you might mail something to an address in another city or country. The post office will check the address and decide where to send it next. For example, if it is to leave the country, we expect one central office to handle all shipments abroad.

In technical terms, a router forwards data packets to the proper network. Usually, a data packet passes through multiple routers before it reaches its final destination. The router functions at layer 3, inspecting the IP address and forwarding the packet to the best network (router) so the packet gets closer to its destination.

There are six routers between the three systems and there are different paths that a packet can use to travel from one system to the other.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719848991082.svg)
