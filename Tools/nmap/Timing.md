Nmap provides various options to control the scan speed and timing.

Running your scan at its normal speed might trigger an IDS or other security solutions. It is reasonable to control how fast a scan should go. Nmap gives you six timing templates, and the names say it all: paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5). You can pick the timing template by its name or number. For example, you can add `-T0` (or `-T 0`) or `-T paranoid` to opt for the slowest timing.

In the Nmap scans below, we launch a SYN scan targeting the 100 most common TCP ports, `nmap -sS 10.10.51.89 -F`. We repeated the scan with different timings: T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4. In our lab setup, Nmap took different amounts of time to scan the 100 ports. The table below should give you an idea, but you will get different results depending on the network setup and target system.

|Timing|Total Duration|
|---|---|
|T0 (paranoid)|9.8 hours|
|T1 (sneaky)|27.53 minutes|
|T2 (polite)|40.56 seconds|
|T3 (normal)|0.15 seconds|
|T4 (aggressive)|0.13 seconds|

In the following screenshots, we can see the time when Nmap sent the different packets. In this screenshot below, with the scan timing being `T0`, we can see that Nmap waited 5 minutes before moving to the next port.

In the screenshot below, Nmap waited 15 seconds between every two ports when we set the timing to `T1`.

Then, the waiting dropped to 0.4 seconds for `T2` as shown below.

Finally, in the default case, `T3`, Nmap appeared to be running as fast as it could, as shown below. It is worth repeating that this would look different on a different lab setup. However, in this particular case, Nmap considered the connection to the target to be fast and reliable, as no packet loss was incurred.

A second helpful option is the number of parallel service probes. The number of parallel probes can be controlled with `--min-parallelism <numprobes>` and `--max-parallelism <numprobes>`. These options can be used to set a minimum and maximum on the number of TCP and UDP port probes active simultaneously for a host group. By default, `nmap` will automatically control the number of parallel probes. If the network is performing poorly, i.e., dropping packets, the number of parallel probes might fall to one; furthermore, if the network performs flawlessly, the number of parallel probes can reach several hundred.

A similar helpful option is the `--min-rate <number>` and `--max-rate <number>`. As the names indicate, they can control the minimum and maximum rates at which `nmap` sends packets. The rate is provided as the _number of packets per second_. It is worth mentioning that the specified rate applies to the whole scan and not to a single host.

The last option we will cover in this task is `--host-timeout <time>`. This option specifies the maximum time you are willing to wait, and it is suitable for slow hosts or hosts with slow network connections.

|Option|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`-T<0-5>`|Timing template – paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5)|
|`--min-parallelism <numprobes>` and `--max-parallelism <numprobes>`|Minimum and maximum number of parallel probes|
|`--min-rate <number>` and `--max-rate <number>`|Minimum and maximum rate (packets/second)|
|`--host-timeout`|Maximum amount of time to wait for a target host|
