### OS Detection

You can enable OS detection by adding the `-O` option. As the name implies, the OS detection option triggers Nmap to rely on various indicators to make an educated guess about the target OS. In this case, it is detecting the target has Linux 4.x or 5.x running. That’s actually true. However, there is no perfectly accurate OS detector. The statement that it is between 4.15 and 5.8 is very close as the target host’s OS is 5.15.

### Service and Version Detection

You discovered several open ports and want to know what services are listening on them. `-sV` enables version detection. This is very convenient for gathering more information about your target with fewer keystrokes. The terminal output below shows an additional column called “VERSION”, indicating the detected SSH server version.

AttackBox Terminal

```shell-session
root@tryhackme:~# nmap -sS -sV 192.168.124.211
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-13 13:33 EEST

```

What if you can have both `-O`, `-sV` and some more in one option? That would be `-A`. This option enables OS detection, version scanning, and traceroute, among other things.  

### Forcing the Scan

When we run our port scan, such as using `-sS`, there is a possibility that the target host does not reply during the host discovery phase (e.g. a host doesn’t reply to ICMP requests). Consequently, Nmap will mark this host as down and won’t launch a port scan against it. We can ask Nmap to treat all hosts as online and port scan every host, including those that didn’t respond during the host discovery phase. This choice can be triggered by adding the `-Pn` option.

### Summary

|Option|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`-O`|OS detection|
|`-sV`|Service and version detection|
|`-A`|OS detection, version detection, and other additions|
|`-Pn`|Scan hosts that appear to be down|
