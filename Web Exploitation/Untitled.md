# types of SQL Injection

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250202005406.png)

## In-band (classic):
· In-band SQLi occurs when the attacker uses the same communication
channel to both launch the attack and gather the result of the attack
Retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page
· Easier to exploit than other categories of SQLi
Two common types of in-band SQLi
· Error-based SQLi
· Union-based SQLi


### Error:

· Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQLi technique that forces the database
to generate an error, giving the attacker information upon which to
refine their injection.
Example:
Input:
`www.random.com/app.php?id='`
Output:
`You have an error in your SQL sytax, check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version ...`

### Union:




## inferential (blind):


### Boolean:


### Time:




## Out-of-Band:
