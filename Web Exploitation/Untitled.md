# types of SQL Injection

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250202005406.png)

## In-band (classic):
· In-band SQLi occurs when the attacker uses the same communication
channel to both launch the attack and gather the result of the attack
Retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page
· Easier to exploit than other categories of SQLi
Two common types of in-band SQLi
· Error-based SQLi
· Union-based SQLi


### Error:

· Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQLi technique that forces the database
to generate an error, giving the attacker information upon which to
refine their injection.
Example:
Input:
`www.random.com/app.php?id='`
Output:
`You have an error in your SQL sytax, check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version ...`

### Union:

· Union-based SQLI is an in-band SQLi technique that leverages the
UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two queries into a
single result set
· Example:
Input:
```
www.random.com/app.php?id=' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
```
Output:
```

## inferential (blind):

· SQLi vulnerability where there is no actual transfer of data via the web
application
· Just as dangerous as in-band SQL injection
· Attacker able to reconstruct the information by sending particular requests
and observing the resulting behavior of the DB Server.
· Takes longer to exploit than in-band SQL injection
· Two common types of blind SQLi
· Boolean-based SQLi
· Time-based SQLi

### Boolean:
Boolean-Based Blind SQLi
· Boolean-based SQLi is a blind SQLi technique that uses Boolean
conditions to return a different result depending on whether the
query returns a TRUE or FALSE result.
Boolean-Based Blind SQLi
Example URL:
www.random.com/app.php?id=1
Backend Query:
select title from product where id -1
Payload #1 (False):
www.randon.com/app.php?id=1 and 1=2
Backend Query:
select title from product where id -1 and 1-2
Payload #2 (True):
www.random.com/@pp.php?id-1 and 1-1
Backend Query:
select title from product where id -1 and 1-1
