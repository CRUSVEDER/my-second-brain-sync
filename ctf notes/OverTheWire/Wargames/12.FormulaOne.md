# FormulaOne

FormulaOne is a wargame that has been rescued from the demise of **intruded.net**, previously hosted on formulaone.intruded.net.

FormulaOne’s levels are called **formulaone0, formulaone1, … etc.** and can be accessed on **formulaone.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2232.

Data for the levels can be found in **/formulaone/**.

_The source code for the first level can be accessed by logging in to a wargame hosted on the same server. Your first task is figuring out which wargame that is._
