Description:
This wargame deals with a lot of regular vulnerabilities found commonly 'out 
in the wild'. While the game makes no attempts at emulating a real environment
it will teach you how to exploit several of the most common coding mistakes 
including buffer overflows, race conditions and privilege escalation.
