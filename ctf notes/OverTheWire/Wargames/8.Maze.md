### Can you find the way out?

Maze is a wargame that has been rescued from the demise of **intruded.net**, previously hosted on maze.intruded.net. **Big thanks to adc, morla and reth** for their help in resurrecting this game!

What follows below is the original description of maze, copied from intruded.net:

```
Summary:
Difficulty:     5/10

Platform:   Linux/x86

Author:

Special Thanks:
je for doing the primary beta-testing.
kuba for beta-testing and ideas.
psi for level9

Description:
You'll need knowledge of exploitation-techniques, programming (of course) and reverse-
engineering. We've tried to make the levels tricky and some of them strange, so get ready
to use gdb.
```

Maze’s levels are called **maze0, maze1, … etc.** and can be accessed on **maze.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2225.

To login to the first level use:

```
Username: maze0
Password: maze0
