### Unique Questions from the Original 29 (After Removing Common Themes)

1. **What costs are associated with buying and selling NFTs, and how do these costs compare across different platforms?** (Original Q12)
   - *Why Unique:* Focuses specifically on the financial expenses (e.g., gas fees, platform fees) and platform variations, not covered elsewhere beyond optimization strategies.

2. **Are there strategies to optimize transaction costs when dealing with NFTs?** (Original Q13)
   - *Why Unique:* Offers actionable ways to reduce costs (e.g., timing, blockchain choice), distinct from just listing costs.

3. **What security risks are associated with owning and trading NFTs, and how can investors protect themselves against these risks?** (Original Q14)
   - *Why Unique:* Addresses specific security threats (e.g., phishing, hacks) and protections, not repeated in ownership or creation mechanics.

4. **How might investment strategies for NFTs differ from those for cryptocurrencies?** (Original Q15)
   - *Why Unique:* Compares NFT investing (rarity-based) to crypto (market-driven), a distinct financial angle not tied to definitions or uses.

5. **What challenges or concerns exist in the NFT space, both technically and ethically?** (Original Q16)
   - *Why Unique:* Covers broad technical (e.g., scalability) and ethical (e.g., scams) issues, beyond specific environmental or copyright concerns.

6. **How do issues like environmental impact or copyright infringement relate to NFTs, and are there ongoing efforts to address these challenges?** (Original Q17)
   - *Why Unique:* Zooms into specific controversies (energy, IP theft) and solutions (e.g., PoS, verification), separate from general challenges.

7. **How is the authenticity of the digital or physical assets represented by NFTs verified?** (Original Q18)
   - *Why Unique:* Focuses on verifying asset legitimacy (e.g., metadata checks), distinct from ownership establishment.

8. **What are some practical use cases for NFTs beyond digital art?** (Original Q19)
   - *Why Unique:* Explores diverse applications (e.g., gaming, tickets), not just categories or industries, broadening the scope.

9. **Can NFTs have utility beyond serving as proof of ownership?** (Original Q21)
   - *Why Unique:* Examines added value (e.g., access, in-game use), separate from what they represent or how they’re used.

10. **How do intellectual property rights apply to NFTs, especially in the context of digital art and collectibles?** (Original Q22)
    - *Why Unique:* Focuses on IP specifics (e.g., copyright ownership), not general legal considerations.

11. **What legal considerations should investors be aware of to avoid potential disputes related to intellectual property?** (Original Q23)
    - *Why Unique:* Provides actionable legal advice (e.g., verify rights), distinct from IP application.

12. **Can you walk through the process of how assets are tokenized into NFTs and the role of blockchain in this process?** (Original Q24)
    - *Why Unique:* Details the technical creation steps (e.g., minting), not overlapped by definitions or ownership mechanics.

### How These Were Determined
- **Removed Redundancies:** 
  - Definition-related questions (Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q26, Q27) overlap heavily—e.g., “What are NFTs?” (Q1) and “What’s non-fungible?” (Q7) repeat uniqueness. I dropped all but the most distinct aspects elsewhere.
  - Ownership questions (Q2, Q9, Q11) repeat blockchain’s role and ownership proof—e.g., Q2 and Q9 both explain what’s owned. Q11’s blockchain role is subsumed in Q24’s process.
  - Scope/types (Q10, Q19, Q20, Q28, Q29) overlap—e.g., Q10 (limits) and Q19 (use cases) both list asset types. I kept Q19 for its practical focus and dropped redundant classifications.
  - Q8 (example) is a subset of uniqueness definitions (e.g., Q1), so it’s excluded.
  - Q25 (tokenization uniqueness) repeats Q24’s process with a comparison twist, so it’s merged into Q24’s broader explanation.
- **Kept Distinct Ideas:** Each of the 12 stands alone—e.g., costs (Q12) don’t overlap with security (Q14) or utility (Q21), ensuring no shared ground.

### Coverage Check
- **Original 29 Mapped:**
  - Q1–Q7, Q26–Q27 → Subsumed in broader uniqueness (not listed separately as they repeat).
  - Q8 → Example fits under uniqueness, not unique enough alone.
  - Q9, Q11 → Ownership overlaps with Q2/Q24, not distinct.
  - Q10, Q20, Q28–Q29 → Scope overlaps with Q19’s use cases.
  - Q12–Q24 → Kept as unique (see list above).
- **No Gaps:** All key topics—costs, security, investment, challenges, utility, legalities, creation—are preserved in these 12. Overlaps like “what’s an NFT?” or “how’s it owned?” are condensed elsewhere (e.g., Q24 covers blockchain’s role).

### Why 12?
- After stripping out repetition (e.g., 8 definition variants, 5 scope questions), 12 remain as the irreducible, unique ideas. Each addresses a standalone aspect—e.g., Q17 (environmental/IP issues) doesn’t repeat Q16’s broader challenges, and Q21 (utility) stands apart from Q19’s use cases.

### Example Application
- Q12 (costs): Gas fees vary—Ethereum $50 vs. Solana $0.01.
- Q14 (security): Phishing risks need hardware wallets.
- Q19 (use cases): Gaming NFTs like Axie pets differ from Q21’s utility (e.g., a sword’s in-game boost).
